# Machine learning algorithms for Titanic dataset

Comparison of different ml algorithms from libraries of made from scratch.

## Software

- Python 3.12
- NumPy 1.26.4
- PyCharm 2024.1.1 (Professional Edition)

## Features

- Implementation of 6 different ML algorithms from scratch
- Comparison of 12 different ML approaches
- Titanic dataset analysis
- Documentation

## Data features
Since this repo is focused on implementation of algorithms, not making the best model for Titanic dataset,
chosen features are:
- Pclass (ticket class)
- Sex
- SibSp (number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (number of parents/children aboard)
